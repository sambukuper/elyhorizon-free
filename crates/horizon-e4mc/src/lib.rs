//! Open the world to anyone, anywhere: e4mc ported to Horizon.
//!
//! e4mc is the Minecraft mod that publishes an open-to-LAN world through its
//! public relay: the host connects out to a quiclime relay over QUIC, the
//! relay assigns the world a public domain, and every guest who joins that
//! domain arrives as one bidirectional stream on the host's session, which
//! this crate bridges to the integrated server's loopback port byte for
//! byte. No port forwarding, no Steam, no account: the address is the
//! world's, and anyone with it can join — e4mc's own design ("Open a LAN
//! server to anyone, anywhere, anytime"), so the player is told what
//! publishing means before they press the button.
//!
//! Guests need nothing from this crate: the domain is a plain server
//! address that any client understands, Horizon's and vanilla's alike.
//! The reference implementation is e4mc-minecraft-architectury's
//! `QuiclimeSession` with [e4mc-quiclime] on the relay side; the wire
//! protocol (ALPN `quiclime`, varint-framed JSON control messages, one
//! stream per guest) is the same.
//!
